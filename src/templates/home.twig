                        etc are some of the main functions of the club. Robonics, the annual workshop of AMU
                        Roboclub has earned a name in itself.<br>
                        The highlights of the club which differentiates it from the peers are its adherence
                        to the curriculum, its student-student interaction and importantly project developments.

                        The strength of the club lies in its Student members, it is them who has given a high repute
                        to the club. The members who complete at least one project under AMU Roboclub are
                        felicitated
                        and they earn for themselves a separate webpage in the AMU Roboclub website which is
                        dedicated
                        for their description and achievements.<br>
                        AMU Roboclub alumni always attribute a portion of their successes to the time and effort
                        they
                        spent at AMU Roboclub which helped them become what they are today.
